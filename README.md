# Content:

Experiment 1: Generation of Random number series  using built-in function and Congruential Random Number Generation Function

Experiment 2: Simulation of Pure Persuit Problem discussed in the Tut/class

Experiment 3: SingleServerQueueSimulation + Generation of Random Numbers

Experiment 4: Calculation of central values for lists(mean,median,mode,variance,standard deviation, coefficient of correlation)

Experiment 5: Simulation of two server, single queue system

Experiment 6: Select the best strategy for inventory management in a tyre shop, as discussed in the Tut/Class.

Experiment 7: Given the age of different persons with their frequencies, calculate simple mean of age and plot graph between age and frequency.Calculate the following statistics of the people mean, median, mode , variance, standard deviation of complete data in scilab/R/phython/c/c++.
    -Generate a list of 100 random numbers between 10-100 representing the age of the people. 
    -Draw the bar graph of people between the age of 10-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100.
    
Experiment 8: To find the Covariance and Correlation For age and frequency Where
    -age=[46,53,29,61,36,39,47,49,52,38,55,32,57,54,4 4] and
    -Frequency = [12,15,7,17,10,11,11,12,14,9,16,8,18,14,12];

Experiment 9: We have data about vehicle performance. Miles per gallon is represented by matrix m and corresponding weight of car is represented by W matrix. Find covariance and correlation between these parameters. Plot the data set.
    -Create two arrays of random numbers representing the weight array and performance array.
    -The weight of the vehicle can be 1000Kg -6000Kg
    -Performance of the vehicle can vary between 6-15gallons/miles
    
Experiment 10: Simulation of Water reservoir for the problem discussed in class.
    -Let the capacity of the Dam be 10000 Units.
    -The river inflow data per month, evaporation and seepage data can be generated using pseudo random numbers.(alternatively can be picked up from historical data for a dam/area available on various web sites). (vol/month)river inflow(10-100 units/month), seepage(1-20 units/month), evaporation varies with season(5-15 units/month).
    -The demand of water for municipality/irrigation supply, can be generated using random numbers (vol/month).(50-150 units/month)
    -Run the simulation month wise and for 50 years and find out how many times there was a failure of dam(not enough water for supply and overflow)
